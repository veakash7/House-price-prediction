# House-price-prediction


This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements a house price prediction model using the California Housing dataset and PyTorch. The model is a simple neural network trained to predict house prices based on various features like median income, house age, and more.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: California Housing dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
- **Model**: A PyTorch neural network with two linear layers and ReLU activation.
- **Objective**: Predict house prices (regression task) using normalized features.
- **Evaluation**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to evaluate model performance.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch scikit-learn numpy
```
